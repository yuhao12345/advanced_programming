Several data structures are tested. 

* Built quadtree and applied Barnes-Hut n-body algorithm to emulate evolution of a multi-body system.
* Constructed augmented array structure to speed up the index search process.
* Compressed file based on binary tree and HashMap.
* Built min-Heap and solved Dijkstra Shortest Path problem.
* Built Huffman tree to encode and decode file.
